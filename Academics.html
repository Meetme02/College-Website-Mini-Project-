            Electronics and Computer Engineering is a branch of Electronics Engineering which deals with the effects of electrons to build components, devices, systems, or equipment. Electrical Engineering basically deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. A bachelor's program in Electronics and Computer Engineering gets you a B.E degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from our institue. Computer engineers may also work on a system's software. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of software engineering, which is usually considered a separate discipline. Electronics and Computer engineering is the integration of electrical engineering and computer science to develop computer systems.

        <p>When we hear the word “Artificial Intelligence”, digital assistants, chatbots, robots, and self- driving cars is what strikes our mind. These are some real examples of artificial intelligence, powerful and interesting. Unlike other technologies, we will continue to see the advancements of AI and Data science.
            AI and Data Science domain is considered one of the most lucrative jobs in the industry right now. With numerous openings spanning across all sectors, data science jobs are showing only the signs of growth. According to Gartner, AI is heralded to create 2.3 million jobs by the end of Year, leading a net gain of 500,000 potentially new jobs.

        <br><p>Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports,hospitals, schools, sewage systems, water treatments, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.
        Subsequently, the course also involves protecting the public and environmental health as well as improving existing infrastructure. Construction activities are one of the main core industries of Indian Economy and therefore an indispensable part of our economy. It generates millions of job opportunities across all sectors and employ trained and semi-skilled professionals. According to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc, the Civil Engineering Market size is expected to grow up to USD 11.72 trillion by 2025.</p>

        <br> <p> Mechanical engineering is a branch of engineering concerned with designing, producing and operating machinery, ranging from ranging from relatively simple items to more complex machinery and even entire facilities and plants.

            Mechanical engineers work to design, develop, build, and test all sorts of mechanical devices, tools, engines and machines. The work of mechanical engineers can take items right through the product lifecycle, from initial design and development through to installation, testing and maintenance.
            
            Working in industries including aerospace, automotive, biotechnology, construction, computing, electronics, manufacturing, medical and more, mechanical engineers can be found developing everything from engine parts, to wind or gas turbines and fuel cells, robots, tools, and more</p>
